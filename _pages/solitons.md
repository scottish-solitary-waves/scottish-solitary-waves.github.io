    What are solitary waves?
  </summary>
  <p>
    Solitary waves are a special class of water waves. For the purposes of this project, they are best defined by a single elevation in the water surface. A soliton will typically span the entire width of a canal. Such a wave is most likely to be seen on its own, upstream of any boat because solitons move faster than the boat that created them and can travel very long distance without changing shape.

    How are solitary waves generated?
  </summary>
    <p>
    Solitary waves are generated when a vessel enters the so-called trans-critical region in terms of blockage and speed. We can express the blockage as $B=A_c/A_b$ where $A_c$ is the canal cross-sectional area and $A_b$ is the boat midship cross sectional area. We also make the speed ($V$) dimensionless by dividing it by the speed of the wave $c=\surd(gh)$, with $g=9.81m/s^2$ and $h$ being the water depth. We call that ratio the depth Froude number $V/\surd(gh)$ which is  analogous to the Mach number in aerodynamics.

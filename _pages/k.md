**Participant Information Sheet**

**Name of department:** Naval Architecture, Ocean and Marine Engineering
 **Title of the study:** Russel&#39;s solitary wave in the 21st century

**Introduction**
&#39;_Russel&#39;s solitary wave in the 21st century_&#39; is a research project carried out by Dr Momchil Terziev, Postdoctoral researcher at the University of Strathclyde, funded by the Royal Society of Edinburgh.

**What is the purpose of this research?**
The purpose of the research is to secure the heritage associated with solitary waves and create an open access map documenting the locations and frequency of occurrence of these waves.

**Do you have to take part?**
Participation is entirely voluntary.

**What will you do in the project?**
One of the outputs from the project is to create a crowdsourced map of solitary waves on Scotland&#39;s canals. To achieve this, information of solitary wave sightings is sought from the public. Such sightings may be submitted by going to the following link: [https://scottish-solitary-waves.github.io/submit-data/](https://scottish-solitary-waves.github.io/submit-data/)

This project will take place between 01/08/2022 and 01/05/2023

**Why have you been invited to take part?**
As a visitor of a canal society in Scotland, you are in the position to observe some unique hydrodynamic phenomena. Solitary waves were discovered here 2 centuries ago on Scotland&#39;s canals, so preserving their heritage is important. If you see a wave ahead of a boat that takes up the entire width of the canal during your visit or any other point, you can participate in the research and help secure solitary waves heritage.

**What are the potential risks to you in taking part?**
There are no risk in participating. However, please take care near water and observe all local health and safety guidance.

**What information is being collected in the project?**
GPS coordinates, photos or even videos are collected. If you see a wave travelling ahead of a boat and taking up the entire canal width, then it is likely a solitary wave was generated by a boat somewhere along the track of the canal. The project seeks information on how often and where these waves are generated. No personal data or personally identifiable data is accepted. For example, photos or videos cannot be accepted.

**Who will have access to the information?**

Solely the chief investigator ,Dr Momchil Terziev, will have access to this information when you submit a sighting until the data is verified to avoid false positives. Once the information is verified, the data will be added to a customised Google map [https://scottish-solitary-waves.github.io/map/](https://scottish-solitary-waves.github.io/map/) and online webpage [https://scottish-solitary-waves.github.io/](https://scottish-solitary-waves.github.io/) under a BY-CC license. This means anyone accessing the webpage or map can see the verified submitted data, adapt, process, or change the information in any way as long as attribution to the original data is given.

**Where will the information be stored and how long will it be kept for?**

Your data, once verified, will be retained indefinitely. If you have any concerns about this, please do not hesitate to contact the chief investigator.

**What happens next?**

First and foremost, enjoy your visit to Scotland&#39;s inland waterways. Should you observe a solitary wave, please consider informing the chief investigator by navigating to this webpage [https://scottish-solitary-waves.github.io/submit-data/](https://scottish-solitary-waves.github.io/submit-data/)where you can submit the location and any photos or videos.

If you would like to find out more, please do not hesitate to contact the chief investigator using the details at the end of this document. Please submit enquiries or feedback about the research, webpage, repository, or data using the same details. These results will not be published elsewhere.

If you do not wish to be involved in this research, I would like to thank you for your attention.

Thank you for reading this information â€“ please ask any questions if you are unsure about what is written here.

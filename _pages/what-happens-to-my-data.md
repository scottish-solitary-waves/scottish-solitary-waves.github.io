The purpose of this page is to explain what happens to submitted data through the [Contribute data](/submit-data) page. 
When you press 'Send', your data is automatically compiled into an email and sent to me directly. That email will contain as much or as little information as you choose to include. If you add your name and email address, I will respond to you, even if it is just to say thanks. Otherwise, there is no way for me to respond since no personal information is collected. 
Note that any items you upload in the form will be inlcuded as an attachment. If the file size is above 25MB, particularly if you wish to upload a video, then please get in touch with me directly and I will arrange for a larger file transfer using cloud storage. If you do not wish to include your email or personal information, you can upload such files to your cloud storage and add the link to the relevant file(s) in the form.

I use open source frameworks to make this webpage work. Therefore, I rely on a number of different systems for hosting this webpage, building the different components of the webpage, including interactive data visualisations, as well as crowdsource data.  I plan on inlcuding a list of all tools I have made use somewhere in this webpage.
As you can see below, when you submit data, I recieve an email from FormSubmit, a secure framework that prevents spam and collects no data on users. 

I recieved ethical approval for collecting data from the University of Strathclyde. You can find more information, including the participant information sheet and consent form here: [Participant Information and consent forms](/files/Participant Information and consent forms.pdf)
